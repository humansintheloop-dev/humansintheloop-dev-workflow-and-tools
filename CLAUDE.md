## Guidelines and Standards

### Commit message guidelines

When writing commit messages, follow these guidelines:

The commit message should be concise and descriptive of the changes made

The first line of the commit message should describe the high-level goal of the change.

If the work is associated with an issue, include the issue number in the commit message

Use "Co-authored by Claude Code" in the commit message instead of "
Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

When converting classes to records, use a concise commit message that simply says which classes were converted. No need to explain method renames or justification.
