Walk me through the design decisions in the design document one by one. This includes:
- Key Design Decisions (section 8)
- Technical Risks and Mitigations (section 9)
- Open Questions (section 10)

For each decision or risk/mitigation:
1. Explain the decision and its rationale (or the risk and proposed mitigation)
2. Ask for my feedback
3. Wait for my response
4. Update the design document if I request changes

After discussing each item, move to the next one until all have been reviewed.

If a design document path is provided as an argument, use that. Otherwise, ask which design document to review.

Start by reading the design document and listing the decisions you will walk through.
