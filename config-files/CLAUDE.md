# Project Guidelines

## Skills

Always invoke the relevant skill before performing these actions:

- **Before creating git commits**: Use the `idea-to-code:commit-guidelines` skill
- **When practicing TDD**: Use the `idea-to-code:tdd` skill
- **When working from a plan file**: Use the `idea-to-code:plan-tracking` skill
- **When creating Dockerfiles**: Use the `idea-to-code:dockerfile-guidelines` skill
- **When moving/renaming files**: Use the `idea-to-code:file-organization` skill
- **When writing multiple similar files**: Use the `idea-to-code:incremental-development` skill

## Code Style

- Prefer intention-revealing method names over comments. If you find yourself writing a comment to explain what code does, extract it into a method whose name conveys the intent.
