Add proper Ctrl+C (SIGINT) and Ctrl+Z (SIGTSTP) signal handling to `i2code implement` for non-interactive subprocess scenarios.

Scope:
- Non-interactive Claude invocation (subprocess.Popen + reader threads)
- Isolarium invocation (subprocess.run, to be converted to Popen)
- Ctrl+C: clean termination with SIGTERM/SIGKILL escalation
- Ctrl+Z: suspend/resume via SIGTSTP/SIGCONT forwarding

Out of scope:
- Interactive Claude (Ctrl+C already propagates naturally via terminal inheritance; Ctrl+Z is consumed by Claude's TUI in raw mode)
- Short-lived subprocess calls (gh CLI in github_client.py)
- Isolarium VM cleanup (VM must never be destroyed by i2code)
- Isolarium's own signal handling (separate work item)

Approach:
- Create a `ManagedSubprocess` context manager that wraps Popen
- Start child processes with `start_new_session=True` for process group isolation
- On KeyboardInterrupt: SIGTERM the child process, wait up to 5 seconds, escalate to SIGKILL
- On SIGTSTP (Ctrl+Z): forward to child process group, then suspend parent; on SIGCONT (fg): forward to child, re-install SIGTSTP handler
- Context manager installs signal handlers in __enter__, restores in __exit__
- Context manager also joins reader threads (stdout/stderr) for complete cleanup
- Print informative messages during cleanup so user knows it's not hung
- Exit with code 130 (Unix SIGINT convention)
- Remove dead signal handling code from branch_lifecycle.py
