Package all workflow scripts in workflow-scripts/ as i2code subcommands, organized into three CLI groups:

- `i2code idea-to-plan` — brainstorm, spec, plan, design-doc (7 subcommands including orchestrator)
- `i2code improve` — analyze-sessions, summary-reports, review-issues, update-claude-files (4 subcommands)
- `i2code setup` — claude-files, update-project (2 subcommands)

The scripts remain as shell scripts initially but are bundled as package data (in src/i2code/scripts/ and src/i2code/prompt-templates/) with thin Click wrappers that exec them via subprocess. This makes the entire workflow installable via uv.

Excluded from scope:
- implement-plan.sh and implement-with-worktree.sh (replaced by i2code implement)
- implement-todo-list.sh and refine-todo-list.sh (deferred)
- _python_helper.sh and requirements.txt (dead code)

Key modifications:
- Config-files-dependent scripts accept config directory as a script argument
- Skill name discovery via a helper script that reads ~/.claude/plugins/cache/
- Original workflow-scripts/ directory removed after migration
