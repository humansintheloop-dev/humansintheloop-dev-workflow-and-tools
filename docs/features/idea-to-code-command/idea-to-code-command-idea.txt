Implement an idea-to-code.sh script in workflow-scripts that takes the user through the idea to code workflow

It has a single parameter that's the directory containing the workflow files

On startup it should determine what steps of the workflow have been completed, and resume the workflow at the correct point by running the appropriate script.

If there is a choice, it should prompt the user which option to do next.
