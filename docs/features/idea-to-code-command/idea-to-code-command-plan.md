# idea-to-code.sh Implementation Plan

**STATUS: Core Implementation Complete** âœ…  
The main functionality has been successfully implemented. Steel Threads 1-8 are complete.
Steel Thread 9 contains optional enhancements that can be added later as needed.

## Overview
This plan implements the idea-to-code.sh workflow orchestrator script using the Steel Thread methodology. Each thread delivers a narrow, end-to-end flow that provides immediate value to users.

## Instructions for Coding Agent
- Mark each checkbox with '[x]' when the task or step is completed
- Run tests after implementing each feature
- Refactor as needed while keeping tests passing
- Commit after each successful thread completion

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
Each steel thread includes test-first development:
1. Write failing test
2. Implement minimal code to pass
3. Refactor while keeping tests green
4. Commit when all tests pass

### Integration Testing
After completing all threads:
1. Test full workflow end-to-end
2. Test all decision branches
3. Test error recovery paths
4. Test with real workflow scripts

### Manual Testing Checklist
[x] Fresh start (no existing files)
[x] Resume from each state
[x] All menu choices
[x] Error conditions
[x] Interrupt handling
[ ] Help and version flags (not implemented - optional enhancement)

## Implementation Notes

### Key Design Decisions
1. State detection based on file existence for simplicity and reliability
2. Interactive menus using standard bash read command
3. Reuse of existing _helper.sh functions
4. No modification of existing workflow scripts
5. Clear separation between orchestration and workflow logic

### Code Quality Guidelines
- Follow existing bash conventions in workflow-scripts/
- Use [[ ]] for conditionals
- Quote all variable expansions
- Use local variables in functions
- Add meaningful error messages
- Keep functions focused and small
