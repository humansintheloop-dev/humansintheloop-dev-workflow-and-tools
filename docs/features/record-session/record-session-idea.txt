I want to record my interactions with Claude Code.

Specifically:
- The prompts that I enter
- Claude's responses
- Tool calls and actions (minimal format showing what was done)

The recordings should be:
- Automatic (always on, no user action needed)
- Saved as markdown files in .claude/sessions/
- Named with timestamps (session-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.md)
- Written incrementally as the conversation happens
- Human-readable and easy to review

This will create a complete history of all my Claude Code sessions that I can review, search, and reference later using my own tools.
