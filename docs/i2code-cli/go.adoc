= `i2code go` -- Workflow Orchestrator

== Overview

`i2code go` is the main orchestrator command that guides you through the entire idea-to-code workflow interactively.
It detects the current state of your idea directory and presents the appropriate options at each step.

== Usage

[source,shell]
----
i2code go <idea-directory>
----

== Parameters

`<idea-directory>`::
Directory containing (or that will contain) workflow files.
If the directory does not yet exist, the orchestrator will create it.

== Workflow States

The orchestrator inspects the idea directory to determine which stage you are at and presents an interactive menu with numbered choices accordingly.

`no_idea`::
No idea file exists yet. Offers to brainstorm a new idea.

`has_idea_no_spec`::
An idea file exists but no specification has been created. Offers to generate a spec.

`has_spec`::
A specification exists but no plan has been produced. Offers to create a plan.

`has_plan`::
A plan exists but implementation has not been completed. Offers to begin or continue implementation.

`complete`::
All workflow stages have been finished.

At every state the menu displays the available actions as numbered choices.
Select a number to proceed.

== Error Handling

If a step fails, the orchestrator presents two options:

* *Retry* -- re-run the failed step.
* *Abort* -- exit the orchestrator immediately.

== Example

[source,shell]
----
i2code go ~/ideas/my-feature
----
