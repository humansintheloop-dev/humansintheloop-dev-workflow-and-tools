== Overview

`i2code` is a UV-installable Python CLI that provides the entire idea-to-code workflow as subcommands.
It bundles workflow shell scripts and prompt templates as package data, with thin Click wrappers that locate the bundled scripts, forward arguments, and propagate exit codes.

== Quick Start Examples

=== Using the Orchestrator (Recommended)

The orchestrator detects your current workflow state, presents appropriate options at each step, and guides you through the entire process interactively.

=== Manual Execution

[source,bash]
----
# 1. Brainstorm your idea
i2code idea brainstorm ~/ideas/my-app

# 2. Create specification
i2code spec create ~/ideas/my-app

# 3. Create implementation plan
i2code plan create ~/ideas/my-app

# 4. Implement the plan
i2code implement ~/ideas/my-app
