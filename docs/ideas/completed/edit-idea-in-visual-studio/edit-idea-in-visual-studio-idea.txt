Enhance i2code go to support editing idea file in Visual Studio Code

When the idea file does not exist, resolve the editor using this priority order:
1. code --wait (if `code` is found on $PATH) — open as .md file
2. $VISUAL (if set)                         — open as .txt file
3. $EDITOR (if set)                         — open as .txt file
4. vi (final fallback)                      — open as .txt file

After the user saves and closes the editor, auto-launch the Claude brainstorm
session as it does today.

No changes to the confirmation flow, menu structure, or brainstorm behavior.
