== Overview

The `implement-plan.sh` script guides the implementation of a project using a pre-defined plan without user stories. It provides Claude with the context needed to execute implementation tasks systematically.

== Purpose

This script:

* Validates that all required planning artifacts exist
* Provides Claude with the complete project context
* Enables iterative implementation with plan updates
* Supports direct implementation from specification and plan
* Runs `claude` interactively enabling the developer to intervene promptly.

== Prerequisites

Before running this script, you must have executed `make-plan.sh` which creates the implementation plan. This script requires the plan file and its dependencies to exist.

Additional requirement: `claude` CLI must be available in the PATH

== Usage

[source,bash]
----
./implement-plan.sh ~/ideas/my-app
----

This will:

. Validate that all planning documents exist
. Launch Claude with the project context
. Allow interactive implementation with plan tracking

== Plan Updates

As implementation progresses, Claude will:

* Mark tasks as completed in the plan file
* Add notes about implementation decisions
* Track any deviations or additional tasks discovered
