== Overview

The `implement-story-plan.sh` script guides the implementation of a project using a story-based implementation plan. It provides Claude with user stories as additional context for more user-focused development.

== Purpose

This script:

* Validates that all required planning artifacts exist including user stories
* Provides Claude with complete project and user story context
* Enables story-driven implementation with plan updates
* Supports implementation aligned with user needs and acceptance criteria

== Prerequisites

Before running this script, you must have executed `make-story-plan.sh` which generates the story-based implementation plan. This script requires the story plan and all its dependencies to exist.

Additional requirement: `claude` CLI must be available in the PATH

== Usage

[source,bash]
----
./implement-story-plan.sh ~/ideas/my-app
----

This will:

. Validate that all planning documents and stories exist
. Launch Claude with the complete project context
. Allow story-driven implementation with plan tracking

== Story-Driven Development

With user stories context, Claude will:

* Implement features aligned with user needs
* Ensure acceptance criteria are met
* Track story completion status
* Maintain traceability between stories and implementation

== Plan Updates

As implementation progresses, Claude will:

* Mark story-related tasks as completed
* Track which stories are fully implemented
* Note any story-specific implementation decisions
* Update the plan with discovered tasks per story
