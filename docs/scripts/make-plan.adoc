== Overview

The `make-plan.sh` script generates an implementation plan directly from the idea and specification files, without using user stories. It creates a task-based roadmap for building the application.

== Purpose

This script:

* Validates that idea and specification files exist
* Invokes Claude to create a structured implementation plan
* Generates a plan file with concrete development tasks
* Provides a foundation for systematic implementation

== Prerequisites

Before running this script, you must have executed `make-spec.sh` which generates the technical specification. This script requires the specification and idea files to exist.

Additional requirement: `claude` CLI must be available in the PATH

== Generated Output

Creates `${IDEA_NAME}-plan.md` containing:

* Prioritized list of implementation tasks
* Technical milestones and dependencies
* Estimated complexity for each task
* Clear completion criteria

== Usage

[source,bash]
----
./make-plan.sh ~/ideas/my-app
----

This will:

. Validate that idea and specification files exist
. Generate an implementation plan based on the specification
. Save the plan to `my-app-plan.md`

== Next Steps

After running this script:

* Review the generated plan for completeness
* Use `implement-plan.sh` to begin implementation
* The plan will be updated as tasks are completed
