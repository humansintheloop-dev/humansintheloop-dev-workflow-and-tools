== Overview

The `make-spec.sh` script creates a detailed technical specification from the brainstormed idea and discussion. It transforms high-level concepts into concrete technical requirements and design decisions.

== Purpose

This script:

* Validates that the idea file exists
* Resumes the existing Claude session from brainstorming
* Generates a comprehensive technical specification
* Creates structured documentation for implementation

== Prerequisites

Before running this script, you must have executed `brainstorm-idea.sh` which creates the idea file, discussion, and session ID. This script continues the same Claude session to maintain context from brainstorming.

Additional requirement: `claude` CLI must be available in the PATH

== Generated Output

Creates `${IDEA_NAME}-spec.md` containing:

* System architecture and design decisions
* Technical requirements and constraints
* API definitions and data models
* User interface specifications
* Non-functional requirements
* Technology stack recommendations

== Session Management

The script uses `--resume` with the existing session ID to:

* Maintain context from the brainstorming phase
* Build upon previous discussions
* Ensure consistency in the development process

== Usage

[source,bash]
----
./make-spec.sh ~/ideas/my-app
----

This will:

. Validate that the idea and discussion files exist
. Resume the Claude session from brainstorming
. Generate a technical specification
. Save to `my-app-spec.md`

== Next Steps

After running this script, you can:

* Create user stories with `make-stories.sh`
* Generate an implementation plan with `make-plan.sh`
* Or create a story-based plan with `make-story-plan.sh`
