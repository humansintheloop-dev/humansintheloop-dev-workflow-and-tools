== Overview

The `make-stories.sh` script generates user stories from the idea and specification files. It creates a set of user-focused requirements with acceptance criteria to guide development.

== Purpose

This script:

* Validates that idea and specification files exist
* Generates comprehensive user stories
* Creates acceptance criteria for each story
* Provides user-centric development guidance

== Prerequisites

Before running this script, you must have executed `make-spec.sh` which generates the technical specification. This script requires the specification and idea files to exist.

Additional requirement: `claude` CLI must be available in the PATH

== Generated Output

Creates `${IDEA_NAME}-stories.md` containing:

* User stories in standard format ("As a... I want... So that...")
* Acceptance criteria for each story
* Story priorities and dependencies
* User personas and their needs
* Epic groupings where appropriate

== Usage

[source,bash]
----
./make-stories.sh ~/ideas/my-app
----

This will:

. Validate that idea and specification files exist
. Generate user stories based on the specification
. Save the stories to `my-app-stories.md`

== Story Format

Generated stories follow best practices:

* Clear user role identification
* Specific desired functionality
* Business value justification
* Measurable acceptance criteria
* Testable success conditions

== Next Steps

After generating stories:

* Review stories for completeness and clarity
* Use `make-story-plan.sh` to create a story-based implementation plan
* Use `implement-story-plan.sh` to begin story-driven development
