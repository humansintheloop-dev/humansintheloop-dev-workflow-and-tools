== Overview

The `make-story-plan.sh` script generates an implementation plan organized around user stories. It creates a task breakdown that aligns development work with user needs and story delivery.

== Purpose

This script:

* Validates that idea, specification, and story files exist
* Creates an implementation plan structured by user stories
* Maps technical tasks to story completion
* Enables incremental delivery of user value

== Prerequisites

Before running this script, you must have executed `make-stories.sh` which creates user stories with acceptance criteria. This script requires the stories, specification, and idea files to exist.

Additional requirement: `claude` CLI must be available in the PATH

== Generated Output

Creates `${IDEA_NAME}-story-plan.md` containing:

* Implementation tasks grouped by user story
* Story dependencies and sequencing
* Technical tasks mapped to acceptance criteria
* Estimated effort per story
* Definition of done for each story
* Release planning suggestions

== Usage

[source,bash]
----
./make-story-plan.sh ~/ideas/my-app
----

This will:

. Validate that all required files exist
. Generate a story-based implementation plan
. Save the plan to `my-app-story-plan.md`

== Plan Structure

The generated plan organizes work by:

* Prioritizing high-value stories first
* Identifying technical prerequisites per story
* Breaking stories into implementable tasks
* Maintaining traceability to acceptance criteria
* Supporting iterative delivery

== Next Steps

After generating the story plan:

* Review the plan for feasibility and completeness
* Use `implement-story-plan.sh` to begin implementation
* Track story completion as development progresses
* Update the plan as new insights emerge
