= Workflow Scripts Command Reference
:toc:
:toclevels: 2

== Overview

This document provides a quick reference to all workflow scripts in the order they should be executed.

NOTE: The slash commands used by these scripts must be installed first via `/plugin install idea-to-code-workflow`.

== Orchestrator Script

* link:idea-to-code.adoc[idea-to-code.sh] - Main orchestrator that guides you through the entire workflow interactively

== Manual Workflow Diagram

If you prefer to run scripts manually instead of using the orchestrator:

----
brainstorm-idea.sh
        ↓
   make-spec.sh
        ↓
    [Choose Path]
        ↓
 ┌──────────────┬────────────────┐
 ↓              ↓                ↓
make-plan.sh   OR   make-stories.sh
 ↓                       ↓
implement-plan.sh   make-story-plan.sh
                         ↓
                 implement-story-plan.sh

== Initial Idea Development

* link:brainstorm-idea.adoc[brainstorm-idea.sh] - Start brainstorming and develop your initial idea
* link:make-spec.adoc[make-spec.sh] - Create technical specification from the brainstormed idea

== Planning Phase

Choose one of the following planning approaches:

=== Direct Planning

* link:make-plan.adoc[make-plan.sh] - Generate implementation plan directly from specification

=== Story-Driven Planning

* link:make-stories.adoc[make-stories.sh] - Create user stories from specification
* link:make-story-plan.adoc[make-story-plan.sh] - Generate story-based implementation plan

== Implementation Phase

Execute the plan created in the planning phase:

=== Direct Implementation

* link:implement-plan.adoc[implement-plan.sh] - Execute the implementation plan (requires make-plan.sh)

=== Story-Driven Implementation

* link:implement-story-plan.adoc[implement-story-plan.sh] - Execute the story-based plan (requires make-story-plan.sh)

== Quick Start Examples

=== Using the Orchestrator (Recommended)

The easiest way to use the workflow is with the orchestrator script:

[source,bash]
----
# Create your project directory
mkdir ~/ideas/my-app

# Run the orchestrator - it will guide you through each step
./workflow-scripts/idea-to-code.sh ~/ideas/my-app
----

The orchestrator will:

* Detect your current workflow state
* Present appropriate options at each step  
* Allow you to retry failed steps
* Guide you through the entire process interactively

=== Manual Execution

For a new project using the story-driven approach:

[source,bash]
----
# 1. Start with your idea
./workflow-scripts/brainstorm-idea.sh ~/ideas/my-app

# 2. Create specification
./workflow-scripts/make-spec.sh ~/ideas/my-app

# 3. Generate user stories
./workflow-scripts/make-stories.sh ~/ideas/my-app

# 4. Create story-based plan
./workflow-scripts/make-story-plan.sh ~/ideas/my-app

# 5. Implement the application
./workflow-scripts/implement-story-plan.sh ~/ideas/my-app
