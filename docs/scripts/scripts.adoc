== Initial Idea Development

* link:brainstorm-idea.adoc[brainstorm-idea.sh] - Start brainstorming and develop your initial idea
* link:make-spec.adoc[make-spec.sh] - Create technical specification from the brainstormed idea

== Planning Phase

Choose one of the following planning approaches:

=== Direct Planning

* link:make-plan.adoc[make-plan.sh] - Generate implementation plan directly from specification

=== Story-Driven Planning

* link:make-stories.adoc[make-stories.sh] - Create user stories from specification
* link:make-story-plan.adoc[make-story-plan.sh] - Generate story-based implementation plan

== Implementation Phase

Execute the plan created in the planning phase:

=== Direct Implementation

* link:implement-plan.adoc[implement-plan.sh] - Execute the implementation plan (requires make-plan.sh)

=== Story-Driven Implementation

* link:implement-story-plan.adoc[implement-story-plan.sh] - Execute the story-based plan (requires make-story-plan.sh)

== Quick Start Example

For a new project using the story-driven approach:

[source,bash]
----
# 1. Start with your idea
./workflow-scripts/brainstorm-idea.sh ~/ideas/my-app

# 2. Create specification
./workflow-scripts/make-spec.sh ~/ideas/my-app

# 3. Generate user stories
./workflow-scripts/make-stories.sh ~/ideas/my-app

# 4. Create story-based plan
./workflow-scripts/make-story-plan.sh ~/ideas/my-app

# 5. Implement the application
./workflow-scripts/implement-story-plan.sh ~/ideas/my-app
