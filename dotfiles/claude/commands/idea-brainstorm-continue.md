Continue asking me questions about the idea described in the idea-file in #$ARGUMENTS

Save the questions and answers in the #$ARGUMENTS discussion file .

IMPORTANT Don't edit the idea file. Later I will ask you create a spec file.

Keep asking me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for this idea. Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed specification I can hand off to a developer. 

Letâ€™s do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail. Remember, only one question at a time.
