I have an idea for some software I want to develop.
The idea to develop the idea description in the #$ARGUMENTS idea file.
Save the questions and answers in the #$ARGUMENTS discussion file .

Once you have the idea:

Ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for this idea. Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed specification I can hand off to a developer. 

I prefer that you defines some sensible and easily changeable default answers for most questions so that you can focus on the most important aspects of the software. If there are multiple options for a question, please list them A B C D, and I will choose one.

Letâ€™s do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail. Remember, only one question at a time.
