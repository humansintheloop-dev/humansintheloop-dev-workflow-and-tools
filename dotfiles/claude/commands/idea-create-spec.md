The #$ARGUMENTS specify the following files:

* idea-file - the file containing the idea description
* discussion-file - the file where questions and answers were saved

Now that weâ€™ve wrapped up the brainstorming process, can you compile our findings into a comprehensive, developer-ready specification? Include all relevant requirements, architecture choices, data handling details, error handling strategies, and a testing plan so a developer can immediately begin implementation.

Save it as a markdown document called #$ARGUMENTS using the following naming convention: for the idea file called '<idea-name>-idea.md', call the specification file '<idea-name>-spec.md'
