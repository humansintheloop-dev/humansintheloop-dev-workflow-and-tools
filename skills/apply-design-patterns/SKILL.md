# Apply Design Patterns

Before implementing or refactoring, consult the design pattern catalog to see if an established pattern applies.

## Steps

1. **Read the catalog index** — `design-pattern-catalog/index.md` lists all documented patterns with a short description of the problem each one solves.

2. **Check for a matching pattern** — if the task involves a problem described in the index, read the full pattern entry.

3. **Follow the pattern** — use the reference implementation and testing strategies documented in the entry. Do not invent a new approach when a cataloged pattern exists.

4. **If no pattern matches** — proceed normally. Not every task needs a cataloged pattern.
