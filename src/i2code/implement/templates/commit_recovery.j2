You are recovering from a failed commit during automated task execution.

The previous run completed a task but failed to commit the changes. Your job is to:
1. Stage all uncommitted changes (including the plan file updates)
2. Generate an appropriate commit message describing the completed task
3. Commit the changes

Plan file: {{ plan_file }}

Summary of uncommitted changes:
```
{{ diff_summary }}
```

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT modify any code or files — only stage and commit
- Use `git add` and `git commit` only
- The commit message should describe the task that was completed
- If you don't have permission to perform an action, print an informative error message and exit

CRITICAL:

Immediately, before exiting output one of the following messages
- If successful: <SUCCESS>recovery commit: COMMIT_SHA</SUCCESS>
- If failed: <FAILURE>Explanation of failure - if permission include those required permissions</FAILURE>
