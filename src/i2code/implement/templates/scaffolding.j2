You are setting up project scaffolding for a new idea.

Read the idea files to understand the project:

* Idea: @{{ idea_directory }}/*-idea.*
* Specification: @{{ idea_directory }}/*-spec.md

Based on the idea files, create minimal project scaffolding that compiles/runs and passes CI:

- If it's a Java project: create a Gradle skeleton (build.gradle, settings.gradle, gradlew wrapper, placeholder source and test that compile and pass)
- If it involves infrastructure or test scripts: create test-scripts/test-end-to-end.sh (executable, exits 0 as placeholder)
- These are not mutually exclusive — create both if the project needs both
- Create .github/workflows/ci.yaml that builds and runs whatever scaffolding you created
- Technology versions and choices should come from the idea/spec files, not from defaults
- Create or update .gitignore with entries to exclude build artifacts and other files that must not be in Git

The goal is a minimal buildable project with passing CI and placeholder code. Do not implement real functionality — just enough for the build and tests to pass.

Commit all scaffolding changes when done. If scaffolding already exists and is sufficient, make no changes.

IMPORTANT:
- Make all changes in a single commit
- The commit message should clearly describe what was fixed
- If you don't have permission to perform an action, print an informative error message and exit

CRITICAL:

Immediately, before exiting output one of the following messages
- If the scaffolding already exists: <NOTHING-TO-DO>No changes needed</NOTHING-TO-DO>
- If successful: <SUCCESS>Scaffold created: COMMIT_SHA</SUCCESS>
- If failed: <FAILURE>Explanation of failure - if permission include those required permissions</FAILURE>
