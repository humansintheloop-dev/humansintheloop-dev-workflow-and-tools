You are implementing the following application:

* Idea: @{{ idea_directory }}/*-idea.*
* Specification: @{{ idea_directory }}/*-spec.md
* Implementation tasks: @{{ idea_directory }}/*-plan.md

Your task:

{{ task_description }}

Follow the active TDD and plan-tracking skills:

Do not work on future tasks until the current one is complete.
If all tasks are complete, stop and report success.
{% if extra_prompt %}

{{ extra_prompt }}
{% endif %}
{% if not interactive %}

IMPORTANT: if you don't have permission to perform an action, print an informative error message and exit
{%- endif %}

CRITICAL:

Immediately, before exiting output one of the following messages
- If successful: <SUCCESS>task implemented: COMMIT_SHA</SUCCESS>
- If failed: <FAILURE>Explanation of failure - if permission include those required permissions</FAILURE>
