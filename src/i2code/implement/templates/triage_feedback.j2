You are triaging feedback on a pull request. Analyze each piece of feedback and categorize it.

The following feedback needs to be triaged:

{{ feedback_content }}

Your task:

1. Review each piece of feedback carefully
2. Categorize each comment as either:
   - "will_fix": You understand what's being asked and can fix it
   - "needs_clarification": The feedback is unclear and you need to ask a question

3. Group related "will_fix" comments that should be addressed together in one commit

4. For "needs_clarification" comments, write a specific, clear question to ask the reviewer

Output your triage as JSON in exactly this format:
```json
{
  "will_fix": [
    {"comment_ids": [123, 456], "description": "Brief description of what to fix"},
    {"comment_ids": [789], "description": "Another fix"}
  ],
  "needs_clarification": [
    {"comment_id": 101, "question": "Your specific question here"},
    {"comment_id": 102, "question": "Another question"}
  ]
}
```

IMPORTANT:
- Use the exact comment IDs from the feedback above
- Group related fixes together
- Be specific in clarification questions
- Output ONLY the JSON, no other text
