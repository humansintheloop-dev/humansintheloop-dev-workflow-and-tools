I want to revise the implementation plan for this application:

* Idea - @${IDEA_FILE}
* Specification - @${SPEC_FILE}
* Implementation plan - @${PLAN_WITHOUT_STORIES_FILE}

Follow the plan-file-management skill for structural operations (inserting, deleting, reordering threads/tasks, and fixing numbering).

You must record any changes to the plan requested during a conversation in the ## Change History section.
